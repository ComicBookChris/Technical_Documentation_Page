                        moderate
                        interior tears may be present.</p>

                        the book's appearance by a perceptible amount.</p>

                    <p>Shows substantial wear; often considered a "reading copy." Cover shows significant wear and may
                        even be
                        detached. Cover reflectivity is low and in some cases completely absent. Book-length creases and
                        dimples
                        may be present. Rounded corners are more common. Moderate soiling, staining, discoloration and
                        foxing
                        may be present. The largest piece allowed missing from the front or back cover is usually a 1/2"
                        triangle or a 1/4" square, although some Silver Age books such as 1960s Marvels have had the
                        price
                        corner box clipped from the top left front cover and may be considered Good if they would
                        otherwise have
                        graded higher. Tape and other forms of amateur repair are common in Silver Age and older books.
                        Spine
                        roll is likely. May have up to a 2" spine split. Staples may be degraded, replaced or missing.
                        Moderate
                        staple tears and stress lines may be present, as well as rust migration. Paper is brown but not
                        brittle.
                        Centerfold may be loose or detached. Moderate interior tears may be present.</p>

                    <p>Shows substantial to heavy wear. Books in this grade are commonly creased, scuffed, abraded,
                        soiled, and
                        possibly unattractive, but still generally readable. Cover shows considerable wear and may be
                        detached.
                        Almost no cover reflectivity remaining. Book-length creases, tears and folds may be present.
                        Rounded
                        corners are increasingly common. Soiling, staining, discoloration and foxing is generally
                        present. Up to
                        1/10 of the back cover may be missing. Tape and other forms of amateur repair are increasingly
                        common in
                        Silver Age and older books. Spine roll is common. May have a spine split between 2" and 2/3 the
                        length
                        of the book. Staples may be degraded, replaced or missing. Staple tears and stress lines are
                        common, as
                        well as rust migration. Paper is brown and may show brittleness around the edges. Acidic odor
                        may be
                        present. Centerfold may be loose or detached. Interior tears are common.</p>

                    <p>Shows heavy wear. Some collectors consider this the lowest collectible grade because comic books
                        in
                        lesser condition are usually incomplete and/or brittle. Cover may be detached, and inks have
                        lost all
                        reflectivity. Creases, tears and/or folds are prevalent. Corners are commonly rounded or absent.
                        Soiling
                        and staining is present. Books in this condition generally have all pages and most of the
                        covers,
                        although there may be up to 1/4 of the front cover missing or no back cover, but not both. Tape
                        and
                        other forms of amateur repair are more common. Spine roll is more common; spine split can extend
                        up to
                        2/3 the length of the book. Staples may be missing or show rust and discoloration. An
                        accumulation of
                        staple tears and stress lines may be present, as well as rust migration. Paper is brown and may
                        show
                        brittleness around the edges but not in the central portion of the pages. Acidic odor may be
                        present.
                        Accumulation of interior tears. Chunks may be missing. The centerfold may be missing if
                        readability is
                        generally preserved. Coupons may be cut.</p>

                    <p>Sufficiently degraded to the point where there is little or no collector value; easily identified
                        by a
                        complete absence of eye appeal. Brittle almost to the point of turning to dust with a touch, and
                        usually
                        incomplete. Extreme fading may render the cover almost indiscernible. May have extremely severe
                        stains,
                        mildew or heavy cover abrasion to the point that some cover inks are indistinct/absent. Covers
                        may be
                        detached with large chunks missing. Can have extremely ragged edges and extensive creasing.
                        Corners are
                        rounded or virtually absent. Covers may have been defaced with paints, varnishes, glues, oil,
                        indelible
                        markers or dyes, and may have suffered heavy water damage. Can also have extensive amateur
                        repairs such
                        as laminated covers. Extreme spine roll present; can have extremely ragged spines or a complete,
                        book-length split. Staples can be missing or show extreme rust and discoloration. Extensive
                        staple tears
                        and stress lines may be present, as well as extreme rust migration. Paper exhibits moderate to
                        severe
                        brittleness (where the comic book literally falls apart when examined). Extreme acidic odor may
                        be
                        present. Extensive interior tears. Multiple pages, including the centerfold, may be missing that
                        affect
                        readability. Coupons may be cut.</p>
